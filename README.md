# Claustroclast - Claustrophobia Exposure Therapy Game

This project contains the code for a 3D game application titled "Claustroclast", created in the `Unity` cross-platform game engine, meant to assist in tempering people's claustrophobia through gradual exposure therapy. 

The game consists of three levels, the environments of which get increasingly more cramped - a forest clearing, city alleyways, and an office server room - in order to acclimate the user to restrictive spaces. The user interacts with the world through a first-person perspective, having to explore the levels in order to find keys that open doors to the following stages.
